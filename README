IMPORTANT NOTES:

(i)  The thesis used data of the "Betriebsvergleich Westfalen-Lippe" [Dög et. 
     al. 2017], which is highly sensitive, for case studies one and two. 
     Therefore a randomized component was added to the data found here. Thus 
     the original results of said case studies can not be reproduced here. For 
     details, see the Master's thesis mentioned above. 

(ii) For the first case study, data from statista.com was used. As Statista 
     GmbH does not allow transferring the data, it has to be obtained manually 
     by the reader from:

     https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/5023/umfrage/entwicklung-des-bruttoinlandsprodukts-von-nordrhein-westfalen-seit-1970/
